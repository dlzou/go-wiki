# go-wiki

A one-day project to learn the basics of Go. I began by following the [official Go tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) for building a simple wiki site, and then I added some features to make it "fully functional":
- Used `regexp` for inter-page hyperlink injection
- Created home page site directory
